A queue is the best data structure because it follows the
FIFO (First In, First Out) rule, which means that the first
order received is processed first.

How it works:

Enqueue: Add a new order (item and quantity) to the back.

Dequeue: Take the order off the front when it is done.

Avoid problems:

Overflow: Use a queue that changes (linked list).

Underflow: Before removing, make sure the queue is empty.

Printing orders: Print each order as it is dequeued to show 
the order in which they were received.
